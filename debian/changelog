blackhole (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added: introducing a new development handler with eye-candy colored
    output.
  * Changed: changed meaning of experimental symbols. Those symbols that are
    wrapped into `experimental` namespace don't adhere semantic versioning and,
    well... experimental.
    Use them with caution and only, where you want to try super-unstable
    features, which can be changed or even dropped.
  * Changed: explicitly hide all symbols from `boost::asio::detail` namespace,
    which are supposed to be hidden by default, but the ancient GNU linker
    exports them anyway.

blackhole (1.0.0-0rc1) unstable; urgency=low

    pattern.

    a severity filter has been added, which can be used to route logging events
    by their severity number.
  * Feature: file appender now has a nice builder class. Strictly speaking, all
    category classes now have a nice builders, including experimental chained
    builder.
  * Feature: flush threshold in file appender configuration now can be specified
    as a binary unit value, i.e. 1000B, 2MB etc.
  * Feature: attribute value can now be constructed from nullptr.

blackhole (1.0.0-0beta1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: file appender should no longer silently eat I/O error while trying
    to open a file.

blackhole (1.0.0-0alpha7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Feature: flush interval option can now be specified in a config to the file
    appender.
  * Feature: added blocking TCP appender to be able to emit log messages via
    TCP socket.
  * API: remove filtering from sink interface, because the filtering concept
    needed to reviewed completely.
    Before this change every sink just returned `true` no matter what. This
    information gave nothing, because otherwise all users must check before
    emitting messages while they can just emit. Instead of this we'd better
    introduce custom filters for sinks that can be applied using special
    filtering decorator.
